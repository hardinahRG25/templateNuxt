            We created Help deski for businesses that share our passion for
            doing right by the customer. For many of us, great customer service
            isn’t a cost center — it’s an effective marketing tool, a
            competitive differentiator, and a cornerstone of the brand.

            But in 2008, there were no customer service platforms available that
            embodied our customer-centric values. There were help desks that
            quite literally treated each person like a number and made it far
            too difficult to build a long-term relationship. We felt a strong
            pull to make something different, and we did.
